# ActiveViam Take-home

Test instructions:

This exercise will require you to create a notebook (we recommend Jupyter) teaching someone how to do the following:
- Use the yfinance library to get data for 5 or so tickers
- Compute PnL (basic profit and loss based on purchase vs current value)
- Visualize using Matplotlib

Prior knowledge of finance is not required, it should be possible to find out what is required through the internet/reading around.

The exercise should not take more than a couple of hours. Some parts of the exercise are left vague, and it is up to you to decide how to proceed.
We would expect answers to the exercise in Python.

You are given 3 working days to return your solution
